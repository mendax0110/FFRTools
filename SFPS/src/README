SFPS - Stochastic Fusor Particle Simulator

This simulates the movement of single particles inside a Fusor.

What data is produced?
We are trying to produce a series of 'maps' that show where:
1	Particles move, where they
1	Fusion events occur, and their frequency
2	How the potential is altered by the congregation of different charged particles occur
